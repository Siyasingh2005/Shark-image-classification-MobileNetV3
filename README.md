# Shark-image-classification-MobileNetV3
 Shark Image Classification using Transfer Learning (MobileNetV3)

This project focuses on the classification of shark species using deep learning and transfer learning with **MobileNetV3**. The goal is to develop an efficient image classification model that accurately identifies shark species from underwater images.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To build a lightweight yet accurate deep learning model that can classify various shark species using transfer learning on MobileNetV3, making it suitable for real-time applications and conservation efforts.
